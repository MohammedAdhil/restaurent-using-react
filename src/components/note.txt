api call in js
--------------

AJAX
    -XMLhttp
    -fetch
    -asynch await


-in react we use useEffect hook instead of ngOninit in angular


Redirection in React
--------------------

react-router-dom

to install   :  npm i react-router-dom

we need to import this : import { BrowserRouter as Router - all routing need components
                                ,Routes                   - to set path for each components
                                ,Route                    - more than one path 
} from 'react-router-dom';

useParams  -  hook used to access params from component url


REDUX
-----

coupling - many connections between parent and child component

props drilling - in coupling if any intermediate component have any errors all other childs will not work.this problem is known as props drilling.

-To avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components independent

-For this react introduced a new technology - 'STATE MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY - REDUX'


redux process
-------------

-create new js file to keep the states , all the components can access the js file

-the components  can access the data from the js file but can't update in js file

logic: 4 pillar are there
        -data.js
        -Component 
        -Action : a file where all the logics to update the state [Dispatch : method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the component need state updation]
        -Reducer : update the datas in js file according to the payload response get from action file

        [component send a dispatch to the action  it send response as a payload to the reducer which finally modify the data in data.js]


Libraries to apply REDUX
------------------------

1-REDUX
2-REACT REDUX
3-REDUX-THUNK

npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() - method in REDUX used to create store in js file
              - 2 arguments are there :
                1 - reducer
                2 - middleware (used to make synchronous redux into asynchronous)

applyMiddleware() - method in REDUX used to apply middleware

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file

reduxthunk() - in Redux-thunk is  used to create middleware


steps:
1.create store 
2.Apply the store in index.js  
    -provider   -  its  a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)
